<h1>Project Euler Problem 1</h1>

    <p>If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.</p>

Solution:

                sum += i;

        /* subtracting 1000 seemed the most straight forward way to take away 1000 from the sum -- otherwise the sum is too big as the problem explicitly wants multiples under but not including 1000. Strangely, setting the upper limit to 999 seems to exclude it for some reason.*/
